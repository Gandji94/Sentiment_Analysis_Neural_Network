# Sentiment_Analysis_Neural_Network

## Project:
The following project attempts to predict/allocate classes according to the text (positive or negative) I let process by our self-created neural network.

I will build a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), specifically a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). The LSTM approach allows the network to remember and learn from past data, and we can overcome the "vanishing gradient problem"** of RNNs.

The data the model will deal with are comments from an e-commerce company. The comments will be divided into positive and negative comments.

## Data Soruce:
The data set is from Kaggle

** The vanishing gradient problem occurs when the gradient becomes very small after being backpropagated many times. They become so small that they more or less "vanish".
